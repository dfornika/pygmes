# pygmes is a wraper for GeneMark-ES

This project aims at making GeneMark-ES more usable. By default 
GeneMark-ES has some problems with fragmented and incomplete genomes.

For metagenomic analysis this is an issue, thus I developed pygmes.

pygmes build on precomputed models to make GeneMark-ES perform on its best. 

More documentation will be hosted on readthedocs.
